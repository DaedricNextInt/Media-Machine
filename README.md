# üéµ Media Machine - 3D iPod Music Player

!(https://imgflip.com/gif/a6d5mc)
**Media Machine** is a unique, cross-platform desktop music player built with Electron. It reimagines the music listening experience by ditching traditional HTML/CSS interfaces in favor of a fully interactive, high-fidelity 3D model of a classic iPod, rendered entirely with `three.js`.

This project combines the power of desktop applications with the creative potential of WebGL to create a nostalgic yet modern media player.
