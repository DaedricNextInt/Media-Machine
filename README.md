Media Machine is a unique, cross-platform desktop music player built with Electron. It reimagines the music listening experience by ditching traditional HTML/CSS interfaces in favor of a fully interactive, high-fidelity 3D model of a classic iPod, rendered entirely with three.js.

This project combines the power of desktop applications with the creative potential of WebGL to create a nostalgic yet modern media player.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive 3D Interface: Navigate a detailed iPod model with your mouse. All UI elements‚Äîfrom the screen to the buttons‚Äîare clickable 3D objects.

Local Music Library: Add music directly from your local folders. The application parses your files and displays them in a scrollable list on the 3D screen.

Real-time Audio Visualization: The iPod's screen and controls come to life with a real-time visualizer that pulses and glows in sync with the currently playing audio, powered by the Web Audio API.

Full Playback Controls: Enjoy complete control over your music with interactive 3D elements for play, pause, skip, repeat, a draggable progress bar, and a vertical volume slider.

Photo Viewer: In addition to music, you can load and view image folders within the "Photos" section of the iPod.

Keyboard & Mouse Navigation: Interact naturally using your mouse to click on controls or your keyboard's arrow keys to navigate lists and menus.
